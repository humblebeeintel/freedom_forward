# Project Name

Hope for Palestine

## Description

This website aims to raise awareness about the ongoing injustices and occupation faced by Palestinians. It contains information on companies and nations enabling the oppression, as well as those advocating for Palestinian human rights. Our mission is to empower readers to join the Palestinian struggle through ethical consumerism, activism, and nonviolent resistance. By inspiring social and economic pressure, we can help bring justice, freedom, and equal rights for all. Together, our collective voices can transcend divides and barriers to demand Palestinian liberation.
